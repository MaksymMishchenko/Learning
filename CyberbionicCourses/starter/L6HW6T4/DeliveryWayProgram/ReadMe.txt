Task 4
There are N customers to whom the manufacturer must deliver the goods. How many possible routes for the delivery of goods, given the fact that the goods will be delivered by one machine?
Using Visual Studio, create a project using the Console Application template.
Write a program that will calculate and display on the screen the number of possible delivery options for the goods. To solve the problem, use the factorial N !, calculated using the do-while loop.
