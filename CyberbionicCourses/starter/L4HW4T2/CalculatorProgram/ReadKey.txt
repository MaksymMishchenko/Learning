Task 2
Using Visual Studio, create a project using the Console Application template.
Write a program - console calculator.
Create two variables named operand1 and operand2. Set the variables to some arbitrary values. Invite the user to enter the sign of the arithmetic operation. Accept the value entered by the user and put it in the string variable sign.
To organize the selection of the computational process algorithm, use the switch switch. Display the result of the arithmetic operation.
In the case of using the division operation, organize a check of the division attempt by zero. And if there is one, then cancel the arithmetic operation and notify the user of the error.

Solution:

1. We create two variables, assign them values ​​over which we will carry out arithmetic operations.
Using the Swith Case branch operator, we create 5 branches: "+", "-", "*", "/", "%".
