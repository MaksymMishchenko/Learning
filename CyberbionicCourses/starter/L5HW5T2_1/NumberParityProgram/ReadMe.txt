Task 2
It is known that for even numbers, the least significant bit is 0
Using Visual Studio, create a project using the ConsoleApplication template.
Write a program that will check the numbers for parity.
Suggest two options for solving the problem.

Solution:

There are two ways to find the parity of a number.
1. Compare the entered number by the user, and if the remainder after the remainder of the number is two more than zero, then output that the number is not even.
2. For even numbers, the least significant bit is 0. We do the check. If the least significant bit is 1, then this is an even number.
