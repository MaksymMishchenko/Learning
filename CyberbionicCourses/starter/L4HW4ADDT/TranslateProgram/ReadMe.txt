Taks 1
Using Visual Studio, create a project using the ConsoleApplication template.
Write a program Russian-English translator. The program knows 10 words about the weather. The user is required to enter a word in Russian, and the program will give him a translation of this word in English. If the user has entered a word for which there is no translation, then a message should be displayed that there is no such word.

Solution

To solve the problem, we use the Switch Case branch operator.
We create 11 branches - 10 for conversion and 1 for default.
We display the translation of the word to the user on the screen. Delay.
