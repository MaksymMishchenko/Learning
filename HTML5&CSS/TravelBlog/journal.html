    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>

    <p>I saw a couple of Burma style signs
        Shave on the side of the road:
    </p>
    <blockquote>If you don't see cars passing by, then
        they can knock you down.
        <blockquote>One moment - and infinity…</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely didn’t want to be run over by a car.

    <p>First day of my trip!
        I can't believe that I was finally able to put everything aside and go on a trip. Because the
        I was going to ride a scooter then
        couldn't take a lot of things with me:
        only cell phone, iPod,
        digital camera and chocolate
        bar. Only everything you need. As Lao Tzu would say:
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step to the scooter</q>
