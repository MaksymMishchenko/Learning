Task 3
There are 3 variables of type int x = 5, y = 10, and z = 15;
Perform and calculate the result of the following operations for these variables:
§  x += y >> x++ * z; 
§  z = ++x & y * 5; 
§  y /= x + 5 | z; 
§  z = x++ & y * 5; 
§  x = y << x++ ^ z;


Solution:

create three variables of type int and assign values ​​to them. We assign each mathematical equation to the var type, print the result of solving the expression on the screen.
