Task 4
Using Visual Studio, create a project using the ConsoleApplication template.
Write a method that will determine:
1) whether the entered number is positive or negative.
2) Is it simple (use the enumeration technique).
(A prime number is a natural number that is divisible by 1 and by itself. To determine a prime number or not, you must find all its integer divisors. If there are more than 2 divisors, then it is not prime.)
3) Is it divisible by 2, 5, 3, 6, 9 without a remainder.

Solution:

1) - We create a method signature with type string and body. In the method body, using the conditional construct if else, check the number for positive and negative. We return the value of a method of type string
In the Main method, we give the opportunity to enter a number to the user. After entering, we display a string to the user, depending on the number entered.
